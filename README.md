# Osu AR Script

This script creates a new difficulty for a given song and sets the Approach Rate (AR) to 10 (or any other you specify).

By default it will only process songs imported during the last hour.

Import songs -> run script -> new difficulties are created -> Go back ingame and hit F5 to refresh new diffs
